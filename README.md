# Inspiration
I am passionate about software dev but I didn't "properly" study software development. After many years of trial an error (and my I say way too few actual production projects) I am writing this to help anybody in their software development journey.

I am hoping this becomes a sort of Wiki that is updated with the latest and best explanations for anything "dev". Someday, hopefully, other people will be maintaing this Wiki (and hopefully they actually know what they're doing). However, for the time being, I hope I find the time and energy to actually put some content here.

Hope you enjoy it!
